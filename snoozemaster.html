		<div class=col>
			<p> A 2022 <a href="https://www.gallup.com/analytics/390536/sleep-in-america-2022.aspx">study</a> conducted by Casper-Gallup discovered that <b>one in three American adults</b> &mdash; representing about 84 million people &mdash; describe their sleep as <b>fair or poor</b>. The same study also reports that the American economy loses an estimated <b>$44.6 billion</b> annually in unplanned absenteeism as a result of poor sleep among workers. As sleep is linked to many health outcomes and an important factor in the economy, this is a crucial problem space that needs to be addressed. </p>
			<p>Due to the limited scope of this course, our target demographic was graduate students at the University of Washington.</p>
