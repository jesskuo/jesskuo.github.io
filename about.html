			<h4>about me &mdash;</h4>
			<p class="lead">Hello! I'm Jessica, a UX designer based in the Bay Area, California. I'm passionate about designing technological solutions that can help people get the help they need, before they even need to ask for help.</p>
			<p>I'm currently a Master's student in Information Management at the University of Washington. Previously, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's in computer science and a minor in data science.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I like exploring new places, playing video games (let's play Valorant!), and drinking boba.</p>
